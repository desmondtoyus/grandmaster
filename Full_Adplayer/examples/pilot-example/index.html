        <h3 style='font-weight: bold'> Invalid Clicks and Impressions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Clicks on ads must result from genuine user interest. Any method that artificially generates clicks or impressions
                on ads is strictly prohibited. These prohibited methods include, but are not limited to, repeated manual
                clicks or –impressions, automated click and impression generating tools, and the use of robots or deceptive
                software. Please note that Sellers may not click on their own ads for any reason.</li>
            <li> Encouraging clicks In order to ensure a good experience for users and advertisers, Sellers may not:</li>
            <li>Compensate users for viewing ads or performing searches, or promise compensation to a third party for such behavior
            </li>
            <li>Encourage users to click the ads using phrases such as “click the ads,” “support us,” “visit these links,” or
                other similar language </li>
            <li>Format ads so that they become indistinguishable from other content on that page </li>
            <li>Format site content so that it is difficult to distinguish it from ads </li>
            <li> Place misleading labels above ad units. For instance, ads may be labeled “Sponsored Links” or “Advertisements,”
                but not “Favorite Sites” or “Today’s Top Offers.”</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style='font-weight: bold'> Traffic Sources Prohibited: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Third-party services that generate clicks or impressions such as paid-to-click, paid-to-surf, auto-surf, and
                click-exchange programs </li>
            <li>Ads promoted through communications or emails that violate the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and any other relevant privacy
                or commercial email laws </li>
            <li>Visitors to the site must be primarily “organic” – meaning the majority of users frequent the site and are not
                solicited via online ads or known in the industry as “marketed” visitors </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style='font-weight: bold'> Ad Delivery/Interaction:</h3>
        <p> To ensure a positive experience for Internet users and advertisers, Sellers may not allow their sites displaying
            ads to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> No ads are allowed to be integrated into a software application of any kind, including toolbars</li>
            <li>Direct user attention to the ads using arrows or other graphical gimmicks </li>
            <li> Place misleading images alongside individual ads</li>
            <li>Place video ads on web pages with more than 1 video player or video ad. Two or more video players or video ads
                on one web page is a violation of the PilotX.tv Terms & Conditions </li>
            <li> Place ads in a floating box script</li>
            <li> Users should be able to easily find what an ad promises</li>

            <li>Place ads in 1×1 pixel placements </li>

                browser settings, or otherwise interfere with site navigation</li>

        </ul>
